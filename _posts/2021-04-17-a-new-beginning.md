Well after a long time using a GCP VM using wordpress by bitnami, I kept getting hacked by cryptominers insert angry face.  And in an attempt in blocking them, I blocked all access to the vm, and could no longer log in.  So here is my attempt at blogging with jekyll.

Check out my [github page][github-page] where I will keep all the demo source that supports this blog.
