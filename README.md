Greetings! My name is Steven Beasley, and I'm an Senior Software Delivery Manager at Cognizant/Softvision.  

I've worked in software development for over 20 years, and my passions are working with dotnet arena, cloud technologies, and kubernetes.  Recently I was promoted into a management position, but I'm still passionate about technology.
